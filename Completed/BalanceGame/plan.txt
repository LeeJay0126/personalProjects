BalanceGame(Java) Plan:

1. make a csv file (or hard code) 64 league of legends characters.
2. User picks a choice they like better and chosen item proceeds to next round.
	How this will work is every rounds, new array will be created and chosen item will be added to the array 
	which will be used for next round of balance game. This continues until array.length is <= 1.


Also considering about adding different options to this program. Such as favourite hollywood star or heros from marvel movie. Or even favorite 
online or mobile game.
